# EYE_rester

#### Eye rester is a simple python app I've developed. 

### The idea behind EYE_rester:
It came into existence as a result of my requirement for a tool that would prompt me to attend to my eye well-being. Hence, I present to you EYE_RESTER!

The functionality of Eye_Rester is aligned with the 20/20/20 eye guideline: you establish a timer that notifies you to shift your focus every 20 minutes, directing your gaze to an object roughly 20 feet away for a complete duration of 20 seconds. This is precisely what Eye_Rester accomplishes! At intervals of 20 minutes, a small window emerges, lasting for 20 seconds, serving as a reminder to redirect your gaze.

> Feel free to download/use/share/develop further, whatever comes to mind! 

###  

#### HOW TO USE:
<li> Download folder 
<li> Open - unzip the downloaded folder 
<li> Make a shortcut of eye_rester_scheduler.pyw
<li> Make sure the file extention is .pyw (otherwise it will open terminal every time it'll run)
<li> Add the shortuct to the Startup folder in your C drive
<li> Enjoy the app from your next restart ;)

> I also made a scalable version of the app. File eye_rester_app_scalable - it runs identically in size on every screen! Can use it as default.
